The SDR function of the [Red Pitaya](https://www.redpitaya.com/) is one of the main reasons I bought my original board. Red Pitaya sent me their new STEMLab 122-16 SDR specific board to try. I have created a comparison of the two boards with samples of their performance on a broadcast radio station.
