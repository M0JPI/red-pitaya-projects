Back in 2016 I bought the [Red Pitaya](https://www.redpitaya.com/) development board to help with an electronics project. After the project I put it down and was busy with other things. Now we're locked-down I got my Red Pitaya out and used it help setup an amateur radio base station.

The Red Pitaya is a single board computer, with an ARM processor, like the Raspberry Pi. There are differences to the Raspberry Pi though, the Red Pitaya does not have an output for a monitor and is accessed though your web browser. It also has some very fast ADCs and DACs for analog inputs and outputs at 50MHz. To process this data it has an FPGA on board as well. These are chips I have heard about since university but never had a go at programming.
During lockdown I got my kit out and have been sent some new boards to try by Red Pitaya themselves.
