Welcome to my blog. Here I hope to record my adventures with electronics, open source programming, amateur radio and the Red Pitaya development boards.
I have created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgw-p_E2i3nQuJ85uvOskqA) to go together with this blog. Please feel free to take a look, like, subscribe and comment on my videos.
