After setting up my amateur radio home station. I wanted to test my antenna performance and see what frequencies it performed best at.
The [Red Pitaya Vector Network Analayzer](https://www.redpitaya.com/f172/vector-network-analyzer-module) was a good tool to do this as I had already bought a Red Pitaya board.

You can see what I found in the video below:
