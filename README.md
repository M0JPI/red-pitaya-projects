# M0JPI Red Pitaya Projects

[My GitHub Repository](https://github.com/M0JPI/red-pitaya-projects) contains a blog recording my progress with the Red Pitaya and a code repository for my projects.

## Blog

[My blog has been built as a Jekyll site](https://m0jpi.github.io/red-pitaya-projects/) with GitHub Pages the source is in the docs folder of this repository.

I have a [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvvInZopn1uD8gIRCfB5gS9av4rGmn3Lc) that demonstrates some of these notebooks on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgw-p_E2i3nQuJ85uvOskqA).
