Back in 2016 one of the original reasons I bought the Red Pitaya was for the logic analyzer feature. I used to to help diagnose problems with a radio project I was working on. I was trying to make a [SatNOGS](https://satnogs.org/) rotator with an Arduino, but had problems communicating with the motor driver board.
I have made a video about using the Logic Analyzer. In my video I use the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) as the microcontroller I am diagnosing communication with.
