The Jupyter Notebook server on the Red Pitaya is the easiest way to program the Red Pitaya. It is especially suited to data science and machine learning as Python modules are available for these and integrate well into the Jupyter system.
I have created two simple projects collecting data from the ADCs and processing in in a Jupyter Notebook.
My first video shows using the slow ADC to collect temperature data from the internal sensor:

{% include video id="AWNtndSbKVQ" provider="youtube" %}

My second video shows using the fast ADC in the audio frequency range to make a sound recording.

{% include video id="A-NwBmFFUCs" provider="youtube" %}
The echo in the video at 16:13 is due to me recording and playing sounds at the same time creating feedback. It is not a fault of the Red Pitaya.
