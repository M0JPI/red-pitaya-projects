Welcome to my GitHub page. On this blog I will share my learning about FPGAs, the [Red Pitaya](https://www.redpitaya.com/), embedded coding, electronics, & software defined radio. My amateur/ham radio callsign is [M0JPI](https://www.qrz.com/db/M0JPI/)
To go along with this blog I have made a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgw-p_E2i3nQuJ85uvOskqA) that shares my ideas and experiments.
